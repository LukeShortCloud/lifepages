401k
----

A 401k is a retirement and investment plan that can be taken out by the age of 59.5. If taken out sooner, there is a 10% penalty/charge to all money that is withdrawn. As of 2021, the maximum that can be put into a 401k plan annually is $19,500. An IRA is exactly the same as a 401k except that it has no limit on how much can be invested and can be taken out much sooner. Consider investing into an IRA after maxing out a 401k.

Companies normally help contribute around 3% to a persons 401k. If the person were to quit and go to another company, they keep all of the money in their 401k as it is tied to the individual.

Employees usually have the option to invest conservatively with low risk or aggressively with high risk. Some people tend to be aggressive when they are younger and, as they get close to retirement, change to conservative investing. Most companies provide employees with the chocie of how to invest their 401k money.

Investing choices:

-  Mutual Funds
-  Index Funds
-  Large-cap Funds
-  Small-cap Funds
-  Foreign Funds
-  Real Estate Funds
-  Bond Funds

All 401k investments are income taxed. A Roth 401k can be used to pay income taxes now as opposed to when a normal 401k would be withdrawn.
