Cost
----

Every ink cartridge has a page yield number. This is the estimated number of pages that can be printed before the cartridge needs to be replaced.

Base equation for the price per each black and white page printed:

``( <BLACK_INK_CARTRIDGE_PRICE> / <PAGE_YIELD> ) + <PAPER_COST>``

The price for a color print will need add this number to the base equation:

``( <COLOR_INK_CARTRIDGE_PRICE> / <PAGE_YIELD> ) x 3``

It is recommended to use a home printer for batches smaller than 100. [1]
