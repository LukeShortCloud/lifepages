Pixel Density
-------------

Pixels per inch (PPI) or per centimeter (PPCM) is the amount of pixels in every square inch of a digital image. The higher the PPI, the better the quality of the photo. When printing, the PPI is converted to dots per inch (DPI) which is the amount of ink dots in every square inch of a print. Ideally, the PPI should be 300 or more as most printers support at least 300 DPI. Depending on the type of printer, the supported DPI will be different:

-  Inkjet printer = 300-720 DPI
-  Laser printer = 600-2400 DPI

[2]

Bleed Area
----------

The "bleed" area of an image is an extra 0.125 inches of space around an image that can be safely cut without losing anything important. This is useful when an image is printed on a paper that is bigger than itself so it can be properly cut down. The bleed area should be an extension of the original image (not a colored border nor anything else that would be added). [3]

Cost
----

Every ink cartridge has a page yield number. This is the estimated number of pages that can be printed before the cartridge needs to be replaced.

Base equation for the price per each black and white page printed:

``( <BLACK_INK_CARTRIDGE_PRICE> / <PAGE_YIELD> ) + <PAPER_COST>``

The price for a color print will need add this number to the base equation:

``( <COLOR_INK_CARTRIDGE_PRICE> / <PAGE_YIELD> ) x 3``

It is recommended to use a home printer for batches smaller than 100. [1]
