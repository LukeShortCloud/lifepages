Speed Reading
-------------

The average person reads about 300 words per minute (WPM). With speed reading techniques, a person can read up to 1500 WPM. [1] Studies show that information retention is lower when reading above 600 WPM. Depending on how redundant the content is, information retention can still be obtained at higher WPMs. [2]

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are the top three tips for beginning to learn speed reading [1]:

1. **Do not say each word in your head.** An average person can read up to 160 words per minute in their head which is a bottleneck.
2. **Do not go back and re-read words or sentences.** In most situations, a person's brain has already retained the information it needs and it will remember it later. If retention is a problem, find a productive environment to read to help with focus.
3. **Use consistent pacing.** A finger or mouse cursor should be used to track the words in the sentence from left to right for each line of text. This consistency keeps your reading speed consistent and your mind focused. With enough practice, a finger or mouse cursor will no longer be necessary once a person's eyes have been trained.
