Hours of Sleep
--------------

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is a period of 1.5 hours where the body is in a deep sleep and an almost conscious state-of-mind while dreaming. If waking up before REM sleep is over, a person will not feel awake or refreshed. [1] The recommended number of hours an adult should sleep is at least 7. [2] That means that **the most optimal amount of time to sleep is 7.5 hours** to align with REM sleep. It is important to sleep in increments that are evenly divisible by 1.5 hours.
