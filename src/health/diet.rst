Plant-Based
-----------

A plant-based/vegan diet consists of all food being, or being made from, plants. No food is sourced from animals. There are three main reasons to follow a plant-based diet:

-  Health
-  Ecological
-  Ethical

Health
~~~~~~

A study shows that vegetarians, who mostly have a plant-based diet, can live up to 9 years longer than people who eat meat. That study also shows that vegans have significantly less fat. [1] Another study shows that vegans are less likely to get heart disease and type 2 diabetes. [2] Other studies show lower risk of bone fractures, diverticular (colon) disease, and even cancer. [3]

Ecological
~~~~~~~~~~

Farming animals produces a large amount of carbon gas, leading to global warming. If the world were to stop farming animals, those gas emissions would go down about 50%. A large amount of land is wasted as 80% of farmlands are for animals. Most of the plant-based produce is wasted on feeding animals. For example, 93% of the world's soya bean (soy) production is fed directly to cattle and not humans. Less soy would need to be produced if it was not required for cattle and only eaten directly by humans. [4] Meat-eaters require 18 times more farmland to produce food than vegans. [6]

Ethical
~~~~~~~

It is unfair to take another animal's life. In most countries and religions it is against the law to kill. Humans are animals so why should they be treated any differently than us? All animals can think and feel like humans because they have a nervous system and a brain (something plants do not). They have the same emotions and can feel pain. [5] Factory farms cram livestock into small and dirty living spaces. They live a miserable life until ultimately being killed. The same awful living situation applies for chickens that lay eggs and cows that produce milk. [7]

Veganism
--------

Being vegan is a life-style choice that expands upon the concepts of having a plant-based diet. It is where people do not buy or support products made with animal products. These include beeswax (bees), feather pillows (ducks), fur (foxes), leather (cows), silk (silkworms), wool (sheep), etc. [2]
