Internal Transfer to a New Job
------------------------------

A person should stay in their current job role for at least one year before switching to another department or team for a few reasons:

-  It is respectful for the person to give the team their time.
-  It is an investment from the department to recruit you and on-board/train you.
-  Some transfers have to wait until the end of the calendar or fiscal year as to negatively effect your departments bookkeeping.
-  It gives the person more time to make connections and brand themselves internally.

Avoid Recruiters
----------------

Instead of being hired on by a recruiter, apply to a company directly. Recruiters usually get a one-time payment that is a percentage of the hired persons salary. For < $100K jobs, this is normally 15%. For >= $100K jobs or roles that are harder to fill, this is normally 25%. [1] By avoiding applying through the recruiter, that money can go into a higher salary or larger sign-up bonus.
