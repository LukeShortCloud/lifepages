Internal Transfer to a New Job
------------------------------

A person should stay in their current job role for at least one year before switching to another department or team for a few reasons:

-  It is respectful for the person to give the team their time.
-  It is an investment from the department to recruit you and on-board/train you.
-  Some transfers have to wait until the end of the calendar or fiscal year as to negatively effect your departments bookkeeping.
-  It gives the person more time to make connections and brand themselves internally.
