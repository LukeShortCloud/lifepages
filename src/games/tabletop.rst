-  `Personality traits <https://www.betterhelp.com/advice/personality/what-are-some-common-dd-personality-traits/>`__.
-  Accent.
-  Character class (pick one) [4]:

   -  Assassin = Stealthy and fast.
   -  Entertainer = Musicians that provide moral support.
   -  Healer = Heals teammates.
   -  Ranger = Long-range weapons.
   -  Soldier = Short-range weapons.

   -  Wizard = Magic.

-  Background story:

   -  What is their goal in life?
   -  What faction are they aligned with?
   -  Why did they pick their class/career?
   -  Where have they lived?
   -  What struggles have they had?
   -  What are their hobbies?

Maps

Interior
^^^^^^^^

Interior maps are used to showcase important buildings, dungeons, and/or ships that players can explore. It should lay out the rooms, corridors, and optionally the furnishing.

Tips for creating a new map [2]:

-  Determine what the building is and it's size.
-  Anything described about the outside should be layed out on the inside as well.
-  The first room sets expectations for what the rest of the building should have.
-  Based on the building type, the types of rooms it would normally have can be determined.

   -  Add a few unexpected rooms to surprise the players.

-  Dungeons

   -  Provide incentive for the players to explore deeper.
   -  Traps should get progressively harder or at least save the biggest trap for the last room.
   -  The players should be able to beat the dungeon. Do not make it impossible.

The Five Room Dungeon Model represents the role of five rooms encountered in sequential order. [3]

1.  Entrance = The entrance is difficult to find or enter.
2.  Challenge = A trap or puzzle that will need to be solved.
3.  Red Herring = False treasure and clues are laid out here.
4.  Climax = Large battle.
5.  Plot Twist = Treasure leads to a new adventure, an enemy is also going for the same treasure, or the treasure is not what was expected.
