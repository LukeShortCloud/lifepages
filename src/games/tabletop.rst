Game Master (GM)

Planning
^^^^^^^^

Unexpected
''''''''''

No game will ever go exactly the way the game master anticipates because of the freedom player characters have. That is okay and part of the fun. Here are some tips on how to handle situations where the players do not follow the story that was originally planned. Focus on preparing these things separate to the main story. Even if they do not get used, they can be recycled and used for a future game session.

-  Create side plots related to the main story.
-  Create additional NPCs with a name, a basic background, some stats, and a story hook.
-  Create additional encounters.
-  Create a loot table full of possible rewards.
-  Create simple maps of nearby locations. They can be filled in with more details later.

Non-Player Characters (NPCs)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Type of NPCs [5]:

-  Minions/Monsters = Short lived and will never been seen or heard of again. Do not waste time on these characters.
-  Guide = Takes players from one place to another. Creates suspense for what is ahead. They are experts in the local territory. Speed up long journeys.
-  Advancement = Helps to reveal missing or misunderstood plot points and to add more plot information. There is always a cost to the player characters for the NPC such as friendship, money, a quest, etc.
-  Rival = Not enemies. Friendly rivalry to motivate the player characters to better themselves.
-  Mentor = The Game Master as a NPC. Never knows the answer. Indirectly guide the players.
-  Long Term = A NPC that has been around for a while. They have emotions and care about what is going on.
-  Support = Do minor simple tasks in the background so the player characters do not have to do it. Remind the player characters of the tasks that were done for them.
-  Comic Reflection = Funny NPC that suggests bad ideas to steer the player characters in the right direction.

Villians:

-  Motive [1]: envy, lazy, love, power, pride, or wrath.
-  Obstacles: what is preventing the villian from reaching their goal?

Maps
^^^^

Interior
''''''''

Interior maps are used to showcase important buildings, dungeons, and/or ships that players can explore. It should lay out the rooms, corridors, and optionally the furnishing.

Tips for creating a new map [2]:

-  Determine what the building is and it's size.
-  Anything described about the outside should be layed out on the inside as well.
-  The first room sets expectations for what the rest of the building should have.
-  Based on the building type, the types of rooms it would normally have can be determined.

   -  Add a few unexpected rooms to surprise the players.

-  Dungeons

   -  Provide incentive for the players to explore deeper.
   -  Traps should get progressively harder or at least save the biggest trap for the last room.
   -  The players should be able to beat the dungeon. Do not make it impossible.

The Five Room Dungeon Model represents the role of five rooms encountered in sequential order. [3]

1.  Entrance = The entrance is difficult to find or enter.
2.  Challenge = A trap or puzzle that will need to be solved.
3.  Red Herring = False treasure and clues are laid out here.
4.  Climax = Large battle.
5.  Plot Twist = Treasure leads to a new adventure, an enemy is also going for the same treasure, or the treasure is not what was expected.
