Real-Time Strategy (RTS)
------------------------

Strategies
~~~~~~~~~~

These are common strategies that apply to most RTS games:

-  Half of the units should be units that gather resources.
-  Focus on economy. A good economy helps to fund large armies and upgrades.
-  Larger armies normally beat smaller optimized armies.
-  Only get upgrades in the late-game. It is important to first focus on the size of the army.
-  Always spend most, if not all, of the available funds to make units and buildings.
-  Learn the macro (simple and big concept) strategies before learning the micro (hard and small concept) strategies.
-  Learn keyboard shortcuts to save time.

Java Versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each version of Minecraft only works with a specific version of Java. [1]

Resource Packs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Resource packs used to be known as texture packs. They allow for more customization beyond textures and can include animations, fonts, sounds, and support for other languages. [2]

The default texture size for Minecraft is 16x16 pixels. [3] The texture resolution size used by resource packs vary. 32-bit Java can only handle 64x64 textures. It is recommended to use a 64-bit installation of Java for bigger textures. [4]

Server (Self-Hosted)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on the use-case of the server, different Minecraft servers are recommended.

-  Vanilla = `SpigotMC <https://www.spigotmc.org/>`__
-  Plugins = SpigotMC
-  Mods, game-changing:

    -  <= Minecraft 1.13 = `Forge <https://forums.minecraftforge.net/>`__
    -  >= Minecraft 1.14 = `Fabric <https://fabricmc.net/>`__

-  Raspberry Pi = `Cuberite <https://cuberite.org/>`__
