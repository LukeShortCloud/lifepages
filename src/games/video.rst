Real-Time Strategy (RTS)
------------------------

Strategies
~~~~~~~~~~

These are common strategies that apply to most RTS games:

-  Half of the units should be units that gather resources.
-  Focus on economy. A good economy helps to fund large armies and upgrades.
-  Larger armies normally beat smaller optimized armies.
-  Only get upgrades in the late-game. It is important to first focus on the size of the army.
-  Always spend most, if not all, of the available funds to make units and buildings.
-  Learn the macro (simple and big concept) strategies before learning the micro (hard and small concept) strategies.
-  Learn keyboard shortcuts to save time.
