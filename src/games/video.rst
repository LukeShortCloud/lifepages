Real-Time Strategy (RTS)
------------------------

Strategies
~~~~~~~~~~

These are common strategies that apply to most RTS games:

-  Half of the units should be units that gather resources.
-  Focus on economy. A good economy helps to fund large armies and upgrades.
-  Larger armies normally beat smaller optimized armies.
-  Only get upgrades in the late-game. It is important to first focus on the size of the army.
-  Always spend most, if not all, of the available funds to make units and buildings.
-  Learn the macro (simple and big concept) strategies before learning the micro (hard and small concept) strategies.
-  Learn keyboard shortcuts to save time.

Minecraft
~~~~~~~~~

Java Versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each version of Minecraft only works with a specific version of Java. [1]

Resource Packs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Resource packs used to be known as texture packs. They allow for more customization beyond textures and can include animations, fonts, sounds, and support for other languages. [2]

The default texture size for Minecraft is 16x16 pixels. [3] The texture resolution size used by resource packs vary. 32-bit Java can only handle 64x64 textures. It is recommended to use a 64-bit installation of Java for bigger textures. [4]

Server (Self-Hosted)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on the use-case of the server, different Minecraft servers are recommended.

-  Vanilla = `SpigotMC <https://www.spigotmc.org/>`__
-  Plugins = SpigotMC
-  Mods, game-changing:

    -  <= Minecraft 1.13 = `Forge <https://forums.minecraftforge.net/>`__
    -  >= Minecraft 1.14 = `Fabric <https://fabricmc.net/>`__

-  Raspberry Pi = `Cuberite <https://cuberite.org/>`__

Forge Mods
^^^^^^^^^^

Galacticraft
''''''''''''

Rockets
&&&&&&&

A rocket is required to get to space. Starting off, all players can build a Tier 1 rocket which allows them to reach an Overworld/Earth space station and the moon. It is required to go to one of the destinations that is unlocked to find a dungeon that has schematics to build the next tier of rocket.

Thermal Padding
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Thermal padding is provided to protect against extreme hot and cold temperatures. The first two tiers of thermal padding are provided by the Galacticraft mod. Tiers 3 through 5 are provided by ExtraPlanets. The naming is not consistent between the two so here is a guide to understand what to craft for each tier:

-  Tier 1 = Thermal Padding [Helm|Chestpiece|Leggings|Boots]
-  Tier 2 = Isothermal [Helm|Chestpiece|Leggings|Boots]
-  Tier 3 = Tier 3 Thermal Padding [Helm|Chestpiece|Leggings|Boots]
-  Tier 4 = Tier 4 Thermal Padding [Helm|Chestpiece|Leggings|Boots]
-  Tier 5 = Tier 5 Thermal Padding [Helm|Chestpiece|Leggings|Boots]

Planets
&&&&&&&

Here are various schematics, items, and ores that can be found in Galacticraft related mods. The pressure level and radiation level only applies when the ExtraPlanets mod is installed. In that case, a space suit is required to protect against pressure. The higher the radiation, the higher tier space suit is required. [16]

Mekanism
''''''''

Mekanism provides many tools and machines that help improve efficiency. This is important for other mods, such as Galacticraft, that require a large amount of resources.

Increase Ore Processing Yields
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

**1x ore processing (tier 0):**

- Estimated time to create from scratch: 30 minutes.

::

   Energized Smelter

**2x ore processing (tier 1):**

- Estimated time to create from scratch: 45 minutes.

::


   Enrichment Chamber --> Energized Smelter

**3x ore processing (tier 2) [5]:**

- Estimated time to create from scratch: 2 hours.

**4x ore processing (tier 3):**

-  Estimated time to create from scratch: 3 hours.
-  Create a Thermal Evaporation Plant. [6][7]

   -  These can be as short as 3 blocks high and as tall as 18 blocks high.
   -  Create the structure with a base of 4x4 Thermal Evaporation Blocks.
   -  Build up walls as high as desired. Leave a 2x2 opening in the middle. Do not cover.
   -  Replace one of the Thermal Evaporation Blocks with a Thermal Evaporation Controller.
   -  Replace two of the Thermal Evaporation Blocks with a Thermal Evaporation Valve.

      -  When complete, the entire Thermal Evaporation Plant will have a special particle effect to showcase that it has been properly built.
      -  Each Valve has two spots that can each be used as input (default) or output.
      -  Use one Valve for input of water via an Electric Pump and Mechanical Pipes.
      -  Use a second Valve for input of heat via a Resistive Heater and Thermodynamic Conductors.

          -  The brine will be created faster the hotter it is. The optimal temperature is 400 degrees Kelvin.

      -  Use a third Valve for output of brine via Mechanical Pipes.

         -  Use the Configurator tool to change the Valve to be an output instead of the default of input.

            -  Use either (1) an Energy Cube or (2) a Chargepad to charge up the Configurator tool.
