Conversations

According to Celeste Headlee, these are the top rules for having a good conversation. Focusing on at least one of these will help improve the conversation. [1]

1. Do not physically or mentally multitask. Focus only on the conversation.
2. Assume that you are going to learn something from the conversation.
3. Ask who, what, when, where, and/or why. Avoid simple yes or no questions.
4. Do not hold onto thoughts of what to say from a part of the conversation that happened earlier.
5. Admit when you do not know something.
6. Do not assume that the experiences of others are the same as your own.
7. Do not repeat yourself.
8. Details do not matter. Avoid stopping the conversation because you are trying to think of exact details.
9. Listen to the other person and try to comprehend what they are saying.
10. Keep your thoughts brief. Do not drag on the conversation.
